## Technical Implementation Details

### Help Content Structure
- **Game Play Controls**: Movement (WASD/arrows), shooting (Space), nuke (Q)
- **Other Controls**: Sound toggle (M), dev mode (Shift+6), release notes (Shift+5), help (Escape)
- **Objective Section**: Game goals and tips

### Mutual Exclusion Logic
- Each toggle function checks `window.devModeControl`, `window.releaseNotesModeControl`, and `window.helpModeControl`
- Only allows opening if no other mode is currently active
- Allows closing regardless of other mode states

### Key Binding Assignment
- **Escape**: Help mode toggle (exclusive)
- **Shift+5**: Release notes toggle
- **Shift+6**: Developer mode toggle
- **Click X**: Close any popup

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Version update
2. `www/js/helpMode.js` - Created new help system
3. `www/index.html` - Added help popup structure and script
4. `www/assets/style.css` - Added help popup styling
5. `www/js/game.js` - Integrated help mode and global controls
6. `www/js/releaseNotesMode.js` - Removed Escape key, added mutual exclusion
7. `www/js/devMode.js` - Added mutual exclusion
8. `README.md` - Updated controls documentation
9. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated controls documentation

## Testing Requirements
- Verify Escape key only toggles help popup
- Confirm only one popup can be open at a time
- Test that game pauses when help is active
- Validate help content displays correctly
- Ensure proper popup closing behavior

## User Experience Improvements
- **Single Popup Policy**: Prevents confusion from multiple overlapping popups
- **Dedicated Help Access**: Easy access to controls via Escape key
- **Clear Instructions**: Each popup shows how to close it
- **Consistent Styling**: All popups maintain visual consistency
- **Game Pause**: Game appropriately pauses when help is displayed

## Additional Session Updates

### 9. Key Binding Change (Escape → H Key)
- **Issue**: Escape key was not working due to browser conflicts and initialization timing
- **Solution**: Changed help toggle from Escape to H key
- **Files Modified**: All help-related files and documentation
- **Reason**: H key is intuitive (Help) and follows same pattern as other single-key bindings

### 10. JavaScript Error Fix
- **Issue**: `pixiAppInstance` variable declared in multiple files causing conflicts
- **Error**: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'pixiAppInstance' has already been declared"
- **Solution**: Renamed variable in helpMode.js to `helpPixiAppInstance`
- **Impact**: Fixed help system loading and functionality

### 11. Help Window UI Improvements
- **Spacing Enhancement**: Increased space between "Game Controls" and "Game Play" (15px → 30px)
- **Spacing Enhancement**: Increased space between "Other" and "Objective" (20px → 35px)
- **Content Cleanup**: Removed "Press H to close" instruction for cleaner display
- **User Experience**: Improved visual hierarchy and reduced clutter

### 12. Title Screen Layout Improvement
- **Enhancement**: Added 15px space between aliens and "How to Play" header
- **Change**: Moved header position from `topBuffer + 215` to `topBuffer + 230`
- **Impact**: Better visual separation and improved readability

### 13. Documentation Updates
- **Files**: README.md, CLAUDE.md, release_notes.md
- **Updates**: Added H key binding documentation
- **Release Notes**: Added comprehensive v0.6.4 changelog with all new features and fixes
