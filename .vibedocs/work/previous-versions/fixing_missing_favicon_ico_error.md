I get this error in the console:

favicon.ico:1 
            
            
           GET http://127.0.0.1:5500/favicon.ico 404 (Not Found)


How can I get rid of it?  Where is the favicon.ico being set?

The `favicon.ico` error indicates that your browser is trying to fetch a small icon (the favicon) for your website, but it can't find it at the default location. This is usually handled in the HTML file, not directly in your JavaScript.

Let me check the root directory to see if there's an `index.html` file where we can address this.

```html
// ... existing code ...
    <title>Galactic Invaders</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="./assets/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
// ... existing code ...
```

I've added a line to your `index.html` to specify the location of the favicon. Now, to completely resolve the 404 error, we need to create the `favicon.ico` file itself.

Since I cannot generate binary `.ico` files directly, I will create a placeholder `favicon.ico` file in the `assets` directory. You will need to replace this placeholder with a proper `.ico` file for your game later. This will stop the 404 error from appearing in your console.

```plaintext
This is a placeholder favicon.ico file.
Please replace this with your actual .ico file.
For example, you can use an online favicon generator to create one from an image.
```

I've addressed the `favicon.ico` error. I've updated `index.html` to correctly reference a favicon, and I've created a placeholder `favicon.ico` file in your `assets` directory. This should stop the 404 error from appearing in your console.

You can now replace the placeholder `assets/favicon.ico` with your actual favicon when you have one ready!
